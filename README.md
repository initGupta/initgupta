## What I Bring
- End-to-end delivery of software projects from planning to launch
- Hands-on development across frontend and backend systems

- Pragmatic problem solving with a focus on maintainability and delivery

## Where I’ve Worked

## Thoughts & Writing
I write about practical engineering topics such as job-queue patterns, Node.js tooling, Web3 basics, React, and performance. These are based on problems I’ve encountered and solved in real projects.
