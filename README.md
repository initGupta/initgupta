# Hi, I’m Dhwaj 👋

I’m a Software Consultant who enjoys turning ideas into shipped products — from architecture and code to teams and production releases. I’ve led and contributed across **PaaS and SaaS** environments, working on **sports betting platforms, AI-driven products, and custom applications**.

## What I Bring
- End-to-end delivery of software projects — from planning to launch
- Hands-on development across frontend and backend systems
- Team ownership, code reviews, and mentoring engineers
- Pragmatic problem-solving with a focus on maintainability and delivery

## Where I’ve Worked
I’ve collaborated with product and engineering teams building:
- Sports tech & betting systems
- Agentic AI products
- Custom business platforms and internal tools

## Thoughts & Writing
I write about practical engineering topics — job-queue patterns, Node.js tooling, Web3 basics, React, and performance — based on problems I’ve encountered and solved in real projects.
